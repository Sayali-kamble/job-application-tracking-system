# Job Application Tracking System

## 📌 Project Overview

Job seekers often apply to multiple jobs across platforms like Naukri, LinkedIn, referrals, and company career portals but lose track of their application status. 
At the same time, recruiters use spreadsheets or other tools, which makes it difficult to track candidates, hiring stages, and overall progress.

This project solves both problems by providing a **role-based Application Tracking System** where:
* **Candidates** can track all their job applications in one place
* **Recruiters** can manage job openings, candidates, and the hiring pipeline efficiently

* Allow candidates to record and monitor applications from external platforms
* Help recruiters manage job openings and candidate pipelines
